assemble APNG animation from PNG image sequences
Command line tool and libraries to create APNG files from
individual PNG files or RGB[A] bitmap data with per-frame delay.
  
The Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) file format is an
extension to the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) specification. It
allows for animated PNG files that work similarly to animated GIF
files, while retaining backward compatibility with non-animated PNG
files and adding support for 8-bit transparency and 24-bit images.
